        <div class="upload-disclaimer">I want everyone to PLEASE upload as many photos of Skip/Maurice/Dad/Pop/Pere Pere, or whatever you called him! Let's
          share what we have! That said, I ask that you only upload photos of him. This is not your Facebook or Instagram
          page and if you want to post pictures of yourself somewhere then that is the place to do it. This site is only
          for photos in which Skip is pictured. Don't get me wrong, the more people in the picture the merrier so if you're
          in a photo with Skip then that's great! Just know that I will delete any photos that do not have Skip in them.
